It is just formation of non overlapping clusters which are similar to one another.

On predicting test data the labels on which the tree or hierarchy can be formed in unknown. \nSimilar thing goes in DBScan clustering, it creates clusters on the theme of reachability and connectivity which is a density function.

Firstly in K-means, a data-point is assigned to the cluster with the closest centroid and then the centroids are updated afterwards. So, predicting in the K-means is actually assigning the datapoints without updating the clusters, given that the prediction data are from the same distribution of data as the training set.\n2. DBSCAN on the other hand finds the cluster based on the high-density areas of the dataset. These densities are parametrized by parameters epsilon and min-points. This is done by computing point properties i.e whether the point is a core, border and noise or outlier. Now during predicting if the new points are close to, say a noise and core point, the point could mess up the previous clustering results and make the noise point a border or within epsilon. This could also be the case with (min-points-1) new points added within the epsilon of noise, which again will recompute the cluster.\n3. Same as DBSCAN, Agglomerative (bottom-up approach) clustering iteratively builds the cluster starting from single data points and successively agglomerates pairs of cluster until all the clusters are merged into a single cluster according to a linkage measure. Let the linkage measure be \"single\", which merges the clusters if all the points between two cluster are less than a threshold. Now adding a new point during prediction could trigger a merge between two clusters that would have been separated otherwise. Thus predicting here also requires recomputing.", "publishedAt": "2022-09-02T17:09:29Z", "likeCount": 4, "replies": [{"authorName": "Talha jutt Zafar", "comment": "mere ko prepration krwane ka XD", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-09-02T19:12:53Z"}]}, {"authorName": "Nadmaan Fazeel", "comment": "DBSCAN doesn't initialize centers because there is no centers in DBSCAN ( it works on connectivity of points). \nKmeans family perform classification( like KNN algorithm) using the previous cluster center and then update the centers. \n\nSolution to this problem :- \nIn R, there is a predict function under DBSCAN class , first it will cluster the data then we have the dataset of data points vs label , here it becomes a classification problem when new points come we will assign a label based on our classification model. \n\nDrawbacks of kmeans \n1.

Recommendation System:\nWhen a person log in, get all the information regarding the person like what product he/she likes, what does the person prefer, get the browsing history of that person. Now based on the product he/she buys, we can set item-based filtering recommendation or collaborative -based filtering. Now, to tackle the cold start problem, whenever a new person comes in for the first time, show what products does he/she likes, show the tags. Once we have the data we get specific based on tag and at least show some recommendation.\n\n2. Facial Recognition:\nFirst we have to determine what are all the range pf products available i.e.what products are available for what part of the face. We have to check if the person is male or female. Train a model or use a pretrained model which will get the facial characteristics of the face, like if it detects a beard then recommend beard oil or a trimmer. For the female recommend cream, lotion based on the marks, spots on the face. This can be done with uploaded photos or real time camera using openCV. Similarly, like the previous to tackle cold start problem, show what products he/she is interested in, show the tags, get the history etc.\n\n3. Logistic Procurement:\nThe main objective here I believe is to show whether or not we need more material or less material for the product. This is a kind of optimization problem where we are minimizing the raw materials needed. I have 2 approach for this-\n  a. First one is model based. First, we have to see what different types of juice are there to make. Based on that we have to see the material we need to build the product. We have get all the characteristics/features of the juice which contributes in using raw materials more or less. We can build a model based on those and either predict whether it will use more or less material (binary classification task) or predict what is amount of material the product is going to use (linear regression task). \n  b. The second way is based on heuristic approach. If the product use different material to to be build i.e. let say some amount of each 'n' material to make a product. Now to minimize the amount needed for each material we can use genetic algorithm to get that or other optimization algorithm to do that.Though this not so efficient, if we have lets say 100 products each using 'n' materials type as we have to do for all.\n\n4. Car Problem:\nThis use case is in kinda broad spectrum. I am no knowledge in car making but still answering it.\n  a. Damage Detection: A car has many parts inside and outside the body. We can separate damage detection in terms of \"analog i.e. mechanical parts and digital i.e. in software parts\".\n      i. For the damage detection in mechanical parts like brakes, engine, tires etc. we can build a model which can detect damage and do segmentation of that part. For this to happen we need to install camera inside the engine hood and underneath the car. A damage can be detected not only by images but with sensors too. The car software can analyze the data to get a warning like this parts seems fishy, kindly check it out.\n     ii. For the damage in the software parts, show warning about the software parts.\nTo make it work both side needs to work together.\n\n  b. AC control: First off sense the outside temperature via sensor, sense the inside of the car also, get the temperature from both sides, then don't turn on the AC immediately just show a prompt on the screen whether or not turn on the AC. Let's keep the action on the user part. Imagine if someone has cold inside the car and suddenly it turn on the AC, good luck.

When one hires a JavaScript developer, one should look for candidate's level of understanding, and whether the candidate can work on your codebase or not.

We need to calculate the sum of the series of the first number. The second input says we have to find the sum of the first number up to the range of the second number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\nfirst_input = 8\r\nsecond_input = 4\r\n\r\nExpected operation:\r\n8^1 - 8^3 + 8^5 - 8^7//we need to write the logic for this operation \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first input we need to generate odd power values\r\nWe need to alternatively add and subtract the powers accordingly\r\n\r\n\r\n 81 - 83 + 85 - 87 .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the above case,\r\n\r\n81 is at the first position(which is odd), so we have to add the value.\r\n83 is at the second position(which is even), so we have to subtract the value.\r\n85 is in the third position(which is odd), so we have to add the value.\r\n87 is in the fourth position(which is even), so we have to subtract the value.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLogical approach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the problem, you need to find the sum S of the series where S = x - x^3 + x^5 - ....... upto N terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are given two inputs, the value of x and no. of terms N.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou need to put the value of x in the given series and calculate sum of the series till N terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nx = 2, N = 5\r\n\r\nS = 2^1 - 2^3 + 2^5 - 2^7 + 2^9 = 410\r\n     0     1     2     3     4\r\n    \r\n    So the output sum of the series is 410\r\n\r\n\r\nTo give you a direction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Above series, if you observe that we find some common patterns\r\n\r\n   1) For even position value we are adding the value\r\n\r\n   2) For odd position value we are substracting value\r\n\r\n   3) For every position exponent (or) power value is increment by 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing in detail :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Use a loop and go over each number between 1 and N.\r\n\r\nfor i in range(0,n) # i go over numbers from 0 to N-1\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Find the iteration value 'i' is even or odd don't forget to initialize the result to 0 before the loop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  if i value is even:\r\n    result = summation of the term value and then added to the result\r\n\r\n  else :\r\n    result = Subtraction of the term value and then added to the result\r\n\r\n\r\n3. For each iteration power value is increment by 2 don't forget to initialize power to 1 before the loop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    power = power + 2\r\n\r\n\r\n4.

I attended his C language community classes and got a broader perspective towards programming for the change. His ability to explain comes with great clarity about that subject. I thoroughly understood the concepts like Binary Language, need to code, purpose of code,. I have already joined his Bootcamp to learn more and get knowledge which he has from years. \r\nSaurabh sir sets a clear path:\r\n1. Programming is fun but it needs time and patience\r\n2. Programming is about trying and exercise your brain cells instead of giving up and searching for the solution  \r\n3. Learning C/C++ enables you to learn other languages much more efficiently \r\nThese were the things I learnt from sir.

I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy the dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.  I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 11` btc with 3.1btc in just 5weeks from day trading with Expert MR.
